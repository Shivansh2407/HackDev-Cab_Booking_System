# TrafficManagement-HACKGRID-2019-
We have created a Mobile Application which makes use of Google Maps API showing free parking spaces with some extended parking lots at abandoned areas and also uses Real Time Image Processing (With Cameras Installed at Every Parking Lot).As soon as the Parking lot get filled the free space count reaches 0 and Hence the Map displayed on the mobile app Hides the Parking lot with Parking Full.Now As the Parking Is full ,to reduce the roadside parking and traffic ,if User Wants to reach there and on time without hassle he/she can make use of our application which on getting the parking full redirects the user to our solely made Quick Cabs (Cab Booking System).This will in a way profit the user to reach their on time at rate of approx. 10% faster without getting indulged in traffic and also its hassle free.It will also promote the control of air pollution as two or more users going in a single direction will be clubbed together in a single cab which will also in turn maximize the profit for the cab driver.
This Helps to Increase the Wages for a Cab Driver,Reduces Roadside Parking(and also traffic) and promotes Control of air pollution.
Cab Project -> A JAVA 8 Application Basically Making Use of Java,Mysql and JDBC connection to store all user data in mysql Whenever user books a Cab.
Parking Manager -> An APK file that authenticates the user and lets him find free Parking spaces.
